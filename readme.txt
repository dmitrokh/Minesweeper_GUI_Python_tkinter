Requirements:
To prevent crashes of the program, it is necessary to keep files myMineSweeper.py, mines50x50.gif, and flag50x50.gif
at the same directory. The program was written in Python 3.4.1 with the usage of Tkinter 8.6.1 and does not require 
installation of any additional modules to Python. 

Required rework: 
For some reason the images of the flag and mine are shown only partially instead of whole size.

Starting the program from command line: 
- python myMineSweeper.py

Updated Project Plan is included in archieve with the program.
